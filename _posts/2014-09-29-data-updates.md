This is an exciting Monday folks: we're now less than a month away from the Toronto municipal election. In honour of the occasion, Every Candidate has added more than 100 updates to [city council](/candidates/#toronto-council) & [school board trustee](/candidates/#toronto-school-board) candidate information.

We continually pull information updates filed by candidates to the City of Toronto, as well as adding data provided by **[you](/get-involved)** (which we quickly fact-check and then add to our [open data sets](/data)). 

Just a quick reminder: Every Candidate is a [100% open-source](/data) & [citizen-driven](/get-inovlved/) initiative -- we rely on individuals like you: each person who contributes a few minutes of their time helps us to maintain what we believe to be the most complete set of information on the 358 candidates for city council and the 127 candidates for school board trustee. 

If you can contribute even 5 minutes of your time -- and all the tasks are easy, trust us! -- please take a look at our [get involved page](/get-involved/).

**If you find this information useful, please consider [getting involved](/get-involved). It only takes a few minutes to help!**
