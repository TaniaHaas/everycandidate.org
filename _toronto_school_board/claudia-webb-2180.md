We received the following e-mail from candidate Claudia Webb on October 5, 2014:

> "After much thought, I have decided not to run for the position of School Trustee and to support another one of the candidates, Aaron Grinhaus, instead.  Unfortunately, it is too late to officially withdraw my name but, if you are able to make it public through your website, it would be much appreciated."
